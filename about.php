<h3>Your work will always be done by Friday</h3>

<p class="intro_text">Hello, my name is Chris Freitag. I am a web and multi-media designer living and working in the metro Detroit area, with my wife Nikki, sons Zachary & Shaun and dog Taylor. I began designing websites in 2001.</p>

<p>I create beautiful, usable, professional websites using best practice accessibility and the latest W3C web standards guidelines, resulting in semantic and seo friendly XHTML and CSS. All my sites are painstakingly and lovingly hand coded.</p>

<p>For building websites my weapons of choice are Fireworks for creating layouts, then Coda to produce clean semantic XHTML and CSS.  I also use Flash and javascript for animations. Don't worry if all these acronyms sound like gibberish, they all mean something that is very good for your business.</p>
